**BinaryTree Class - Readme**

## Overview

The `BinaryTree` class is a versatile implementation of a binary search tree data structure in the `MATH_EXTENSIONS.MathsExt.Trees` namespace. It provides functionalities to create, modify, and traverse a binary tree with the primary goal of maintaining the left-child-right-child organization, where the lowest values are on the left and the highest values on the right.

## Features

The `BinaryTree` class offers the following key features:

1. **Insertion**: Nodes can be inserted into the binary search tree while maintaining the sorting order.

2. **Removal**: Nodes with specific values can be removed from the tree while preserving the binary search tree properties.

3. **Find Minimum and Maximum**: The class allows finding the minimum and maximum values present in the binary tree.

4. **Count Nodes**: The number of nodes in the tree can be counted using the `CountNodes` method.

5. **Get Depth (Height)**: The depth (height) of the binary tree can be determined with the `GetDepth` method.

6. **Traversals**: The class supports pre-order, in-order, post-order, and level-order traversals, each returning the nodes as a list.

7. **Balancing**: The `BalanceTree` method can be used to reorganize the tree to achieve better balance, reducing search time complexity.

8. **Serialization**: The `Serialize` and `Deserialize` methods allow converting the binary tree to a string and recreating the tree from a serialized string, respectively.

9. **Clearing**: The `Clear` method clears the binary tree, making it empty.

## Getting Started

To use the `BinaryTree` class in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Namespace Import**:
   Import the required namespace in your code file:
   ```vb.net
   Imports MATH_EXTENSIONS.MathsExt.Trees
   ```

2. **Create a Binary Tree**:
   Instantiate a new `BinaryTree` object with an initial value (root node):
   ```vb.net
   Dim binaryTree As New BinaryTree(10)
   ```

3. **Insert Nodes**:
   Add more nodes to the binary tree using the `Insert` method:
   ```vb.net
   binaryTree.Insert(5)
   binaryTree.Insert(15)
   binaryTree.Insert(3)
   binaryTree.Insert(7)
   ```

4. **Remove Nodes**:
   Remove a specific value from the binary tree:
   ```vb.net
   binaryTree.Remove(15)
   ```

5. **Traversal**:
   Traverse the binary tree in different orders and get the nodes as lists:
   ```vb.net
   Dim inOrderList As List(Of Integer) = binaryTree.InOrderTraversalToList()
   Dim preOrderList As List(Of Integer) = binaryTree.PreOrderTraversalToList()
   Dim postOrderList As List(Of Integer) = binaryTree.PostOrderTraversalToList()
   Dim levelOrderList As List(Of Integer) = binaryTree.LevelOrderTraversalToList()
   ```

6. **Find Minimum and Maximum**:
   Get the minimum and maximum values present in the binary tree:
   ```vb.net
   Dim minValue As Integer = binaryTree.FindMin()
   Dim maxValue As Integer = binaryTree.FindMax()
   ```

7. **Count Nodes and Get Depth**:
   Determine the total number of nodes and the depth of the binary tree:
   ```vb.net
   Dim nodeCount As Integer = binaryTree.CountNodes()
   Dim treeDepth As Integer = binaryTree.GetDepth()
   ```

8. **Balance the Tree**:
   Reorganize the binary tree to achieve better balance:
   ```vb.net
   binaryTree.BalanceTree()
   ```

9. **Serialization and Deserialization**:
   Convert the binary tree to a serialized string and recreate the tree from a serialized string:
   ```vb.net
   Dim serializedTree As String = binaryTree.Serialize()
   Dim deserializedTree As BinaryTree = BinaryTree.Deserialize(serializedTree)
   ```

10. **Clearing the Tree**:
    Clear the binary tree and make it empty:
    ```vb.net
    binaryTree.Clear()
    ```

## Note

The `BinaryTree` class is designed to handle integer values for the nodes. For other data types or complex objects, you may need to customize the class accordingly.
