# TrieTree - Trie Tree Data Structure in VB.NET

**TrieTree** is a VB.NET implementation of the Trie Tree data structure, a tree-like data structure used for efficiently storing and retrieving a large collection of strings. Each node in the tree represents a single character, and paths from the root node to the leaf nodes form complete strings.

## Features

- Efficiently store and retrieve a large collection of strings.
- Supports adding strings iteratively using characters or words.
- Check if a given string or prefix exists in the trie.
- Provides various methods for displaying the contents of the trie.

## Usage

### Creating a Trie Tree

```vb.net
Dim trie As New TrieTree()
```

### Adding Strings to the Trie Tree

```vb.net
Dim trie As New TrieTree()

' Add string iteratively using characters
trie.InsertByCharacters("hello")

' Add string iteratively using words
trie.InsertByWord("world")

' Add string iteratively using characters (iterative method)
trie.AddItterativelyByCharacter("example")

' Add string iteratively using words (iterative method)
trie.AddItterativelyByWord("usage example")
```

### Checking if a String Exists in the Trie Tree

```vb.net
Dim trie As New TrieTree()

' Add strings to the trie
trie.InsertByCharacters("hello")
trie.InsertByWord("world")

' Check if specific strings exist in the trie
Dim exists1 As Boolean = trie.FindWord("hello") ' True
Dim exists2 As Boolean = trie.FindSentence("world") ' True
Dim exists3 As Boolean = trie.FindPrefix("he") ' True
Dim exists4 As Boolean = trie.FindSentPrefix("wo") ' True
```

### Displaying the Contents of the Trie Tree

```vb.net
Dim trie As New TrieTree()

' Add strings to the trie
trie.InsertByCharacters("hello")
trie.InsertByWord("world")

' Display the contents of the trie
Dim treeViewNode As System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode = trie.ToView()
' Now, you can add this `treeViewNode` to a TreeView control to visualize the trie structure.
```
